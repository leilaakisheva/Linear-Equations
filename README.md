# Linear-Equations
In this assignment we had to create functions for Gauss Elimination and LU decomposition methods and compare their performance for various N - number of dimensions. It was asked to find the equilibrium positions of two blocks which have different eq. of motions. This task was implemented using Gauss Elimination method and LU decomposition method.
